Introduction
============

Thrift is a xmind for data structure and algorithm.

 I referred to the teacher's textbook at this time，It needs to be improved later，I will continue to update.

I went to two company interviews this week, and found that the questions I could do before are a little difficult to write now
Continue to try to practice with the teacher five times.
